## Introduction

This tutorial will demonstrate several ways of processing a list of input protein structures (in `.pdb` or `.cif` file format) to generate output `.npz` files containting a mesh representation of the protein and corresponding surface features.

We provide a script `pnabind/scripts/generate_protein_meshdata.py` for 

## Processing for Inference
To process files for inference (no training labels)
